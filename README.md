## Introduction to OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which can be used for a wide range of tasks, including image and video analysis, object detection, facial recognition, and more. OpenCV is widely used in the fields of computer vision, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

## Getting Started

To start working with this repository, you'll need to have OpenCV installed on your system. If you haven't already, you can follow the official OpenCV installation guide for your specific platform: [OpenCV Installation Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)

Once OpenCV is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/shriyaa01/working_on_opencv.git
```

## Reading Images

In this repository, you will find code for reading images using OpenCV. The code demonstrates how to load an image from your local filesystem and display it using OpenCV. It also provides information on basic image properties.

## Reading Videos

You will also find code for reading videos using OpenCV. This code demonstrates how to capture video from a webcam or from a video file. You can use this script to display the video feed and save it to an output file.

## Rescaling and Resizing

Additionally, the repository provides code for rescaling and resizing both images and videos using OpenCV. This code allows you to change the dimensions of images and videos while maintaining aspect ratios.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository by adding more OpenCV-related code examples, improving the existing documentation, or suggesting enhancements, please feel free to create a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated.
